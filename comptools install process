Python >= 3.6 (PyTables-3.5 was the last release with Python 2.7 support)

HDF5 >= 1.8.4 (>=1.8.15 is strongly recommended)

NumPy >= 1.19.0

Numexpr >= 2.6.2

c-blosc >= 1.4.1 (sources are bundled with PyTables sources but the user can use an external version of sources using the BLOSC_DIR environment variable or the â€“blosc flag of the setup.py)



### minhashing / lsh
-  "How similar is this document to that document".
- 10000 words long, we break it down into 9996 shingles, and randomly select say 200 
- SHINGLES = words or characters

PLAN
1. Break down the document a set of shingles.
2. Calculate the hash value for every shingle.
3. Store the minimum hash value found in step 2.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with different hash algorithms 199 more times to get a total of 200 min hash values.


Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) 
= generating a hash code such that similar items will tend to get similar hash codes
